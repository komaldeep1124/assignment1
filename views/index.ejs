                        <p class="mission">I want the world to be a better place because of my actions, 
                        and because of the impact I have on other people. Also, on my bad days,
                         where it seems I can't do anything right, I hope I don't mess things up too badly.          
                    I also want to lead by example. I feel a good attitude, whether it is at sports or 
                    in the office, is a valuable mentoring device. With that said,
                     I will take the opportunity to act as an example and teach anyone I meet.
                      I've taught youth league basketball. I've volunteered on numerous organizations
                       and committees.
                         I try to foster good relationship with my friends. Overall, I try to lead a good life.</p>
